# Paragraph Read More JS
If there is more than one non-blank paragraph inside the class, the other 
paragraphs will be hidden inside a read more link.

Clicking on the read more link will show the hidden text.
Clicking on the link again (now called, read less) will hide the text again.

#How to Use
Wrap the paragraphs inside the class "can-read-more".
Then include the included javascript file (readMore.js)

Ex.

```
<div class="filter-intro-text main-content can-read-more">
    <h1>Thailand Weddings</h1>
    <p>This will show</p>
    <p>This will only show when Read more is clicked</p>
    <p>This too</p>
</div>
```
